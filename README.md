1. Drawing Autopilot

Added an autopliot drawing button at the left-top corner.
You can enable/disable it by clicking the button.
The autopilot will draw 10 random shapes with random colors in a second.
This generates a random, colorful, and beautiful picture by the program. May give you some inspiration and beauty of abstract art.

To prevent too many shapes overwhelm the screen and slow down the program, the autopilot will stop drawing when there are more than 100 shapes on the screen.
But you are allowed to draw more shapes in draw mode by hand. And other operations are still available.

This function added a new way to play with this app. You can use it to draw a picture or just let it draw for you.


2. Sound Effect + Backgound Change
Added sound effect for activating/deactivating the autopilot drawing mode.
Added sound effect for drawing a shape.
Added sound effect for erasing a shape.

Adding sound effect could make the app to have more interaction with the user, letting the user know what they are doing by appling both visual and auditory feedback.

BackGround color could be changed by using the picker at the bottom of the canvas.
